## **What We Will Build in This Chapter** 🛠️📌

### **1️⃣ Pagination for Post List View** 📄
- We will implement **pagination** to split the post list into multiple pages.
- This will improve **performance and user experience** when browsing blog posts.

### **2️⃣ Class-Based Views** 🏗️
- We will refactor the existing **post_list view** into a **class-based view**.
- Class-based views provide a more **structured and reusable** approach compared to function-based views.
- The new view will be called **PostListView**.

### **3️⃣ Sharing Posts via Email** 📧
- We will create the **post_share view** to allow users to **share posts via email**.
- Django’s **forms and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** will be used to send recommendations.
- Users will be able to send **post links** to their friends directly from the blog.

### **4️⃣ Adding a Comment System** 💬
- We will build a **Comment model** to store comments for blog posts.
- A **post_comment view** will be implemented to allow users to leave comments.
- Django’s **model-based forms** will be used to handle user input.
