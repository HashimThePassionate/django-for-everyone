# **Building List and Detail Views in Django** 🌐✨

Now that you understand how to use the Django ORM, you are ready to build **views** for the blog application. Views handle **web requests** and return **web responses**, forming the core logic of your application. ✨✨✨

---

## What is a Django View? 🤔
A **Django view** is a Python function (or class-based view) that:
- Receives an **HTTP request**.
- Processes the request with necessary logic.
- Returns an **HTTP response** (e.g., rendered HTML, JSON, or an error response).

## Steps to Create Views 🛠️
1️⃣ **Create Application Views** 📝
   - Define view functions or class-based views to process data.

2️⃣ **Define URL Patterns** 🔗
   - Map each view to a specific URL using Django’s `urls.py`.

3️⃣ **Create HTML Templates** 🎨
   - Use templates to render data dynamically and return HTML responses.

### Example Flow:
- **User requests a URL** → **Django routes the request** → **View fetches data** → **Template renders the data** → **User sees the output**.
