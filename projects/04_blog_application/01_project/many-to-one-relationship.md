# 📖 Understanding Many-to-One Relationships in Django

This README explains how to implement and understand a **many-to-one relationship** in Django by connecting posts to their authors. Authors are users, and each post is written by one author, but an author can write multiple posts.

### ✨ Introduction to Many-to-One Relationships

A **many-to-one relationship** connects one object (e.g., a `Post`) to another (e.g., a `User`). This means:

- 👤 **One user** can write **many posts**.  
- 📝 **Each post** belongs to **only one user**.  

Django's `ForeignKey` field is used to establish this relationship. With the help of the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting, we connect the posts to Django’s default user model.

---

### 🖋️ Adding an Author to the Post Model

To implement this relationship, we add an `author` field to the `Post` model. This field connects the `Post` model to Django's `User` model through a foreign key.

Here’s how the updated `Post` model looks:

---

### 🔑 Key Components of the Code

#### 1. 📌 **ForeignKey Field**
- 🔗 The `ForeignKey` creates the **many-to-one** relationship.  
- 📜 Syntax:
  ```python
  author = models.ForeignKey(
      settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
      on_delete=models.CASCADE,
      related_name='blog_posts'
  )
  ```

#### 2. 🛠️ **on_delete Parameter**
- ⚙️ Determines what happens to posts when their associated user is deleted.  
- **`on_delete=models.CASCADE`**: When a user is deleted, all their related posts are also deleted.  
- 📖 Learn more: [Django ForeignKey.on_delete](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete)  

#### 3. 🔗 **related_name Attribute**
- 🧩 Provides an easy way to access all posts written by a user.  
- 💡 Example: `user.blog_posts.all()` will return all posts written by a specific user.

### 💻 Full Code Example

Here’s the complete implementation of the `Post` model with the many-to-one relationship:

```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone

class Post(models.Model):
    class Status(models.TextChoices):
        DRAFT = 'DF', 'Draft'
        PUBLISHED = 'PB', 'Published'

    title = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=250)
    author = models.ForeignKey(
        settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name='blog_posts'
    )
    body = models.TextField()
    publish = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
    created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    status = models.CharField(
        max_length=2,
        choices=Status.choices,
        default=Status.DRAFT
    )

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-publish']
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['-publish']),
        ]

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

### 📂 Synchronizing the Database

After updating the model, make the changes reflect in the database:

1. ⚙️ Run migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
2. ✅ Verify the changes:
   - Use the Django admin or shell to create a user and assign posts to them.  
   - Example:
     ```python
     from django.contrib.auth.models import User
     from blog.models import Post

     user = User.objects.create(username='hashim')
     post = Post.objects.create(title='My First Post', author=user)
     ```
