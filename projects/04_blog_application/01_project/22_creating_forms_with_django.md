## 🔍 Introduction to Django Forms

Django's **forms framework** is a powerful tool that streamlines the process of creating, rendering, and validating HTML forms. Whether you're building simple contact forms or complex data submission interfaces, Django forms provide a structured and secure way to handle user input.

**Key Features of Django Forms:**
- **Field Definitions:** Easily define form fields with specific data types and validation rules.
- **Automatic HTML Rendering:** Generate clean and consistent HTML form elements.
- **Data Validation:** Ensure submitted data adheres to defined rules before processing.
- **Security Measures:** Protect against common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

In this guide, we'll focus on creating a form that allows users to share blog posts via email, enhancing user engagement and expanding your blog's reach.

---

## 🛠️ Building the EmailPostForm

To begin, we'll define a form that captures the necessary information for sharing a blog post via email. Django provides two primary base classes for forms:

- **Form:** Ideal for standard forms where form fields are not directly tied to Django models.
- **ModelForm:** Best suited for forms that create or update model instances, automatically generating form fields based on model fields.

For our email sharing functionality, we'll use the **Form** base class since the form isn't directly creating or updating a model instance.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

### **1. Create `forms.py` in Your Blog Application**

First, navigate to your blog application's directory and create a new file named `forms.py`. This file will house all form definitions related to the blog.

```bash
your_project/
├── blog/
│   ├── migrations/
│   ├── templates/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── forms.py  # ← Newly created
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py
└── your_project/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py
```

### **2. Define the EmailPostForm**

Open the newly created `forms.py` file and add the following code:

```python
from django import forms

class EmailPostForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(max_length=25)
    email = forms.EmailField()
    to = forms.EmailField()
    comments = forms.CharField(
        required=False,
        widget=forms.Textarea
    )
```

### **Explanation of the Form Fields:**

- **`name`:** Captures the sender's name. It's a `CharField` with a maximum length of 25 characters to ensure concise input.
  
  ```python
  name = forms.CharField(max_length=25)
  ```
  
- **`email`:** Captures the sender's email address. Being an `EmailField`, it ensures that the input adheres to a valid email format.
  
  ```python
  email = forms.EmailField()
  ```
  
- **`to`:** Captures the recipient's email address. Similar to the `email` field, it validates the input format.
  
  ```python
  to = forms.EmailField()
  ```
  
- **`comments`:** Allows the sender to include optional comments in the email. It's a `CharField` that's not required (`required=False`) and uses a `Textarea` widget for multi-line input.
  
  ```python
  comments = forms.CharField(
      required=False,
      widget=forms.Textarea
  )
  ```

### **3. Understanding Widgets and Validation**

Each form field in Django comes with a default widget that determines how it's rendered in HTML. For instance, `CharField` defaults to an `<input type="text">` element. However, you can customize this behavior:

- **Custom Widgets:** Override default widgets to change how form fields are displayed. In the `comments` field, we use `forms.Textarea` to render a `<textarea>` instead of the default `<input>`.

- **Field Validation:** Django forms automatically validate data based on field types. For example:
  - `EmailField` ensures the input is a valid email address.
  - `CharField` respects the `max_length` constraint.
  - Setting `required=False` makes a field optional.

For a comprehensive list of available form fields and their functionalities, refer to [Django's Form Fields Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/forms/fields/).

## 📂 Structuring Your Django Project for Forms

Organizing your project files logically enhances maintainability and scalability. Here's a recommended structure focusing on form integration:

```bash
your_project/
├── blog/
│   ├── migrations/
│   ├── templates/
│   │   └── blog/
│   │       └── post/
│   │           ├── list.html
│   │           ├── detail.html
│   │           └── share.html  # ← Template for sharing posts
│   ├── static/
│   │   └── css/
│   │       └── blog.css
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── forms.py  # ← Form definitions
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py  # ← View handling form submission
└── your_project/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py
```

**Key Directories and Files:**

- **`forms.py`:** Contains all form classes.
- **`templates/blog/post/share.html`:** Template for rendering the email sharing form.
- **`views.py`:** Handles form rendering and processing.
- **`urls.py`:** Defines URL patterns, including the one for the form.
- **`settings.py`:** Configures email settings and other project configurations.

---

## 🏗️ Handling Forms in Views

Views in Django are responsible for processing user requests, rendering templates, and managing form submissions. We'll create a view named `post_share` that displays the email sharing form and handles its submission.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

### **1. Import Necessary Modules in `views.py`**

Open `views.py` and add the following imports at the top:

```python
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render
from .forms import EmailPostForm
from .models import Post
```

### **2. Define the `post_share` View**

Add the `post_share` function to handle both displaying the form and processing its submission:

```python
def post_share(request, post_id):
    # Retrieve post by id
    post = get_object_or_404(
        Post,
        id=post_id,
        status=Post.Status.PUBLISHED
    )
    sent = False

    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Form was submitted
        form = EmailPostForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Form fields passed validation
            cd = form.cleaned_data
            # ... send email
            sent = True
    else:
        form = EmailPostForm()

    return render(
        request,
        'blog/post/share.html',
        {
            'post': post,
            'form': form,
            'sent': sent
        }
    )
```

### **Explanation of the View Logic:**

1. **Retrieving the Post:**
   
   ```python
   post = get_object_or_404(
       Post,
       id=post_id,
       status=Post.Status.PUBLISHED
   )
   ```
   
   - **Purpose:** Fetches the blog post based on `post_id` and ensures it's published.
   - **`get_object_or_404`:** If the post doesn't exist or isn't published, Django returns a 404 error.

2. **Initializing the `sent` Variable:**
   
   ```python
   sent = False
   ```
   
   - **Purpose:** Tracks whether the email has been successfully sent. This flag is used to display a success message in the template.

3. **Handling POST Requests:**
   
   ```python
   if request.method == 'POST':
       # Form was submitted
       form = EmailPostForm(request.POST)
       if form.is_valid():
           # Form fields passed validation
           cd = form.cleaned_data
           # ... send email
           sent = True
   ```
   
   - **Purpose:** Processes the form submission.
   - **`request.method == 'POST'`:** Checks if the form was submitted.
   - **`form.is_valid()`:** Validates the submitted data. If valid, proceeds to send the email.
   - **`form.cleaned_data`:** Contains the validated form data.

4. **Handling GET Requests:**
   
   ```python
   else:
       form = EmailPostForm()
   ```
   
   - **Purpose:** Initializes an empty form for the user to fill out.

5. **Rendering the Template:**
   
   ```python
   return render(
       request,
       'blog/post/share.html',
       {
           'post': post,
           'form': form,
           'sent': sent
       }
   )
   ```
   
   - **Purpose:** Renders the `share.html` template with the post details, form instance, and the `sent` flag.

### **3. Complete `views.py` Example**

Here's how your `views.py` should look after adding the `post_share` view:

```python
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render
from .forms import EmailPostForm
from .models import Post

def post_share(request, post_id):
    # Retrieve post by id
    post = get_object_or_404(
        Post,
        id=post_id,
        status=Post.Status.PUBLISHED
    )
    sent = False

    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Form was submitted
        form = EmailPostForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Form fields passed validation
            cd = form.cleaned_data
            # ... send email
            sent = True
    else:
        form = EmailPostForm()

    return render(
        request,
        'blog/post/share.html',
        {
            'post': post,
            'form': form,
            'sent': sent
        }
    )
```

## ✉️ Configuring Email Settings Securely

Sending emails from your Django application requires proper SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) configurations. It's crucial to handle these settings securely to protect sensitive information like email credentials.

### **1. Understanding Django's Email Settings**

Django provides several settings to configure email functionalities:

- **`EMAIL_HOST`:** SMTP server host (default is `localhost`).
- **`EMAIL_PORT`:** SMTP server port (default is `25`).
- **`EMAIL_HOST_USER`:** Username for the SMTP server.
- **`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`:** Password for the SMTP server.
- **`EMAIL_USE_TLS`:** Enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) if set to `True`.
- **`EMAIL_USE_SSL`:** Enables SSL if set to `True`.
- **`DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`:** Default sender email address.

For enhanced security and flexibility, it's recommended to load these settings from environment variables rather than hardcoding them into your source code.

---

### 🔐 Working with Environment Variables

Using environment variables ensures that sensitive information remains secure and isn't exposed in your codebase. We'll utilize the **python-decouple** library to manage these variables effectively.

#### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

### **1. Install `python-decouple`**

`python-decouple` simplifies the management of environment variables in Django projects.

```bash
pip install python-decouple==3.8
```

> **Note:** Specifying the version (`3.8`) ensures compatibility and stability.

### **2. Create a `.env` File**

In your project's root directory (same level as `manage.py`), create a file named `.env`. This file will store all your environment-specific settings.

```bash
touch .env
```

### **3. Define Email Configuration in `.env`**

Open the `.env` file and add your email credentials:

```env
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_account@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=My Blog <your_account@gmail.com>
```

- **`EMAIL_HOST_USER`:** Your Gmail address.
- **`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`:** The app password you'll generate shortly.
- **`DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`:** The default sender's name and email in the format `Name <email>`.

> **Security Tip:** Ensure that the `.env` file is **never** committed to your version control system. Add it to your `.gitignore` file:

```gitignore
# .gitignore
.env
```

### **4. Update `settings.py` to Use Environment Variables**

Open your project's `settings.py` and modify it to load email configurations from the `.env` file:

```python
from decouple import config

# Email server configuration
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = config('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = config('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD')
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = config('DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL')
```

### **Explanation of Settings:**

- **`EMAIL_HOST`:** Specifies Gmail's SMTP server.
- **`EMAIL_PORT`:** Port `587` is standard for SMTP with TLS.
- **`EMAIL_USE_TLS`:** Enables TLS for secure email transmission.
- **`DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`:** Sets the default sender's information.

### **5. Alternative Email Backends for Development**

During development, you might not want to send real emails. Django offers an **email backend** that writes emails to the console instead of sending them:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
```

- **Purpose:** Useful for testing without sending actual emails.
- **Usage:** Add this line to `settings.py` during development and remove or comment it out in production.

### **6. Handling Two-Step Verification with Gmail**

To use Gmail's SMTP server, especially when two-step verification is enabled, you'll need to create an **App Password**.

#### **Creating an App Password:**

1. **Enable Two-Step Verification:**
   
   - Navigate to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
   - Under **"Signing in to Google"**, enable **2-Step Verification**.

2. **Generate App Password:**
   
   - After enabling two-step verification, go to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
   - Select **"Mail"** as the app and **"Other (Custom name)"** as the device.
   - Name it (e.g., "Django Blog") and click **"Generate"**.
   - Copy the 16-character app password.

3. **Update `.env` File:**
   
   ```env
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here
   ```

> **Important:** App passwords provide a secure way to use your Gmail account with third-party applications without exposing your main account password.

---

### 🔄 Testing Email Functionality

Before integrating email sending into your views, it's essential to test your email configurations to ensure everything is set up correctly.

#### **Step-by-Step Testing:**

### **1. Open the Django Shell**

Launch the Django interactive shell to test sending emails:

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

### **2. Send a Test Email**

Execute the following commands within the shell:

```python
from django.core.mail import send_mail

send_mail(
    'Django mail',
    'This e-mail was sent with Django.',
    'your_account@gmail.com',
    ['your_account@gmail.com'],
    fail_silently=False
)
```

### **Explanation of Parameters:**

- **`subject`:** The subject line of the email.
- **`message`:** The body content of the email.
- **`from_email`:** Sender's email address. If set to `None`, Django uses `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`.
- **`recipient_list`:** A list of recipient email addresses.
- **`fail_silently`:** If `False`, Django raises exceptions for email sending errors.

### **3. Verify Email Receipt**

Check your inbox to confirm the receipt of the test email. If using the console email backend, check your terminal for the email output.

### **4. Handling Common Errors**

- **`CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` Error:**
  
  - **Cause:** SSL certificate verification issues.
  - **Solution:** Install or upgrade the `certifi` package:
    
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade certifi
    ```
  
  - **macOS Specific:** Ensure Python has access to macOS root certificates by running:
    
    ```bash
    /Applications/Python\ 3.12/Install\ Certificates.command
    ```

> **Note:** Replace `Python\ 3.12` with your installed Python version if different.

---

## 🔗 Integrating Email Functionality into Views

With email configurations tested and working, we'll now integrate the email-sending capability into the `post_share` view to allow users to share blog posts via email.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

### **1. Update the `post_share` View in `views.py`**

Modify the `post_share` function to send emails upon valid form submission:

```python
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render
from .forms import EmailPostForm
from .models import Post

def post_share(request, post_id):
    # Retrieve post by id
    post = get_object_or_404(
        Post,
        id=post_id,
        status=Post.Status.PUBLISHED
    )
    sent = False

    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Form was submitted
        form = EmailPostForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Form fields passed validation
            cd = form.cleaned_data
            post_url = request.build_absolute_uri(
                post.get_absolute_url()
            )
            subject = (
                f"{cd['name']} ({cd['email']}) recommends you read "
                f"{post.title}"
            )
            message = (
                f"Read {post.title} at {post_url}\n\n"
                f"{cd['name']}'s comments: {cd['comments']}"
            )
            send_mail(
                subject=subject,
                message=message,
                from_email=None,  # Uses DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
                recipient_list=[cd['to']]
            )
            sent = True
    else:
        form = EmailPostForm()

    return render(
        request,
        'blog/post/share.html',
        {
            'post': post,
            'form': form,
            'sent': sent
        }
    )
```

### **Explanation of the Added Code:**

1. **Building the Absolute Post URL:**
   
   ```python
   post_url = request.build_absolute_uri(
       post.get_absolute_url()
   )
   ```
   
   - **Purpose:** Constructs the full URL to the blog post, including the domain and protocol (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/2024/1/1/who-was-django-reinhardt/`).
   - **`get_absolute_uri()`:** Combines the relative URL from `get_absolute_url()` with the current domain and protocol.

2. **Creating the Email Subject and Message:**
   
   ```python
   subject = (
       f"{cd['name']} ({cd['email']}) recommends you read "
       f"{post.title}"
   )
   message = (
       f"Read {post.title} at {post_url}\n\n"
       f"{cd['name']}'s comments: {cd['comments']}"
   )
   ```
   
   - **Purpose:** Formats the email's subject and body using the validated form data.
   - **`cd`:** Stands for **Cleaned Data**, containing the form's validated inputs.

3. **Sending the Email:**
   
   ```python
   send_mail(
       subject=subject,
       message=message,
       from_email=None,  # Uses DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
       recipient_list=[cd['to']]
   )
   ```
   
   - **`from_email=None`:** Instructs Django to use the `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` setting.
   - **`recipient_list`:** List containing the recipient's email address.

4. **Updating the `sent` Flag:**
   
   ```python
   sent = True
   ```
   
   - **Purpose:** Indicates that the email was successfully sent, allowing the template to display a success message.

### **2. Complete `views.py` Example with Email Integration**

```python
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render
from .forms import EmailPostForm
from .models import Post

def post_share(request, post_id):
    # Retrieve post by id
    post = get_object_or_404(
        Post,
        id=post_id,
        status=Post.Status.PUBLISHED
    )
    sent = False

    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Form was submitted
        form = EmailPostForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Form fields passed validation
            cd = form.cleaned_data
            post_url = request.build_absolute_uri(
                post.get_absolute_url()
            )
            subject = (
                f"{cd['name']} ({cd['email']}) recommends you read "
                f"{post.title}"
            )
            message = (
                f"Read {post.title} at {post_url}\n\n"
                f"{cd['name']}'s comments: {cd['comments']}"
            )
            send_mail(
                subject=subject,
                message=message,
                from_email=None,  # Uses DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
                recipient_list=[cd['to']]
            )
            sent = True
    else:
        form = EmailPostForm()

    return render(
        request,
        'blog/post/share.html',
        {
            'post': post,
            'form': form,
            'sent': sent
        }
    )
```

## 🌐 Updating URL Patterns

To enable users to access the email sharing form, we'll add a new URL pattern that routes to the `post_share` view.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

### **1. Open `urls.py` in the Blog Application**

Navigate to your blog application's `urls.py` file, typically located at `blog/urls.py`.

### **2. Add the `post_share` URL Pattern**

Append the following line to your `urlpatterns` list:

```python
path('<int:post_id>/share/', views.post_share, name='post_share'),
```

### **Complete `urls.py` Example**

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

app_name = 'blog'

urlpatterns = [
    # Post views
    path('', views.PostListView.as_view(), name='post_list'),
    path(
        '<int:year>/<int:month>/<int:day>/<slug:post>/',
        views.post_detail,
        name='post_detail'
    ),
    path('<int:post_id>/share/', views.post_share, name='post_share'),  # New URL pattern
]
```

### **Explanation:**

- **`<int:post_id>/share/`:** Defines the URL pattern for sharing a post via email. It captures the `post_id` as an integer.
- **`views.post_share`:** References the `post_share` view function.
- **`name='post_share'`:** Assigns a name to the URL pattern for easy reference in templates.

> **URL Example:** `/blog/5/share/` would route to the `post_share` view for the post with `id=5`.

## 🎨 Rendering Forms in Templates

Templates are responsible for presenting forms to users and displaying feedback based on form submissions. We'll create a `share.html` template to render the email sharing form and display success messages upon successful submissions.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

### **1. Create `share.html` Template**

Navigate to `blog/templates/blog/post/` and create a new file named `share.html`.

```bash
your_project/
├── blog/
│   ├── templates/
│   │   └── blog/
│   │       └── post/
│   │           ├── list.html
│   │           ├── detail.html
│   │           └── share.html  # ← Newly created
│   ├── static/
│   │   └── css/
│   │       └── blog.css
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── forms.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py
└── your_project/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py
```

### **2. Add HTML Code to `share.html`**

Open `share.html` and insert the following code:

```django
{% extends "blog/base.html" %}

{% block title %}Share a Post{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    {% if sent %}
        <h1>E-mail successfully sent</h1>
        <p>
            "{{ post.title }}" was successfully sent to {{ form.cleaned_data.to }}.
        </p>
    {% else %}
        <h1>Share "{{ post.title }}" by e-mail</h1>
        <form method="post">
            {{ form.as_p }}
            {% csrf_token %}
            <input type="submit" value="Send e-mail">
        </form>
    {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

### **Explanation of the Template:**

1. **Extending the Base Template:**
   
   ```django
   {% extends "blog/base.html" %}
   ```
   
   - **Purpose:** Inherits the layout and styling from `base.html`, ensuring consistency across pages.

2. **Setting the Page Title:**
   
   ```django
   {% block title %}Share a Post{% endblock %}
   ```
   
   - **Purpose:** Defines the content for the `title` block in `base.html`, setting the page's title.

3. **Defining the Content Block:**
   
   ```django
   {% block content %}
       {% if sent %}
           <!-- Success Message -->
       {% else %}
           <!-- Email Sharing Form -->
       {% endif %}
   {% endblock %}
   ```
   
   - **Purpose:** Determines whether to display the email sharing form or a success message based on the `sent` flag.

4. **Displaying the Success Message:**
   
   ```django
   {% if sent %}
       <h1>E-mail successfully sent</h1>
       <p>
           "{{ post.title }}" was successfully sent to {{ form.cleaned_data.to }}.
       </p>
   {% else %}
       <!-- Email Sharing Form -->
   {% endif %}
   ```
   
   - **Purpose:** Shows a confirmation message after a successful email submission.

5. **Rendering the Email Sharing Form:**
   
   ```django
   <form method="post">
       {{ form.as_p }}
       {% csrf_token %}
       <input type="submit" value="Send e-mail">
   </form>
   ```
   
   - **`method="post"`:** Specifies that the form data should be sent via a POST request.
   - **`{{ form.as_p }}`:** Renders the form fields wrapped in HTML `<p>` tags for better readability.
   - **`{% csrf_token %}`:** Inserts a CSRF token to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
   - **Submit Button:** Allows users to submit the form.

### **6. Complete `share.html` Example**

```django
{% extends "blog/base.html" %}

{% block title %}Share a Post{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    {% if sent %}
        <h1>E-mail successfully sent</h1>
        <p>
            "{{ post.title }}" was successfully sent to {{ form.cleaned_data.to }}.
        </p>
    {% else %}
        <h1>Share "{{ post.title }}" by e-mail</h1>
        <form method="post">
            {{ form.as_p }}
            {% csrf_token %}
            <input type="submit" value="Send e-mail">
        </form>
    {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```
### Edit the blog/post/detail.html template and make it look like this:

```django
{% extends "blog/base.html" %}
{% block title %}{{ post.title }}{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
 <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
 <p class="date">
 Published {{ post.publish }} by {{ post.author }}
 </p>
 {{ post.body|linebreaks }}
 <p> # new line
 <a href="{% url "blog:post_share" post.id %}">
 Share this post
 </a>
 </p>
{% endblock %}
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Forms

After setting up the form, view, and template, it's crucial to test the functionality to ensure everything works as intended.

### **Step-by-Step Testing:**

### **1. Start the Development Server**

Ensure your Django development server is running:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### **2. Create Test Posts**

- Navigate to the Django admin interface: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/blog/post/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/blog/post/).
- **Create at least four posts:**
  - Ensure each post's **status** is set to **Published**.
  - Fill in all necessary fields like title, slug, body, and publish date.

### **3. Access the Blog Posts**

- Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/).
- **Verify Pagination:**
  - The first page should display the first three posts.
  - The second page should display the fourth post.

### **4. Test the Email Sharing Form**

1. **Navigate to a Post Detail Page:**
   
   - Click on any post title to view its detail page, e.g., [http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/2024/1/1/who-was-django-reinhardt/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/2024/1/1/who-was-django-reinhardt/).

2. **Access the Share Form:**
   
   - Click on the **"Share this post"** link, which directs you to the email sharing form, e.g., [http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/5/share/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/5/share/).

3. **Fill Out and Submit the Form:**
   
   - **Valid Submission:**
     - Enter a valid name, sender email, recipient email, and optional comments.
     - Click **"Send e-mail"**.
     - **Expected Outcome:** A success message appears confirming that the email was sent.
     - **Verify:** Check the recipient's inbox for the email.
   
   - **Invalid Submission:**
     - Leave required fields empty or enter invalid email formats.
     - Click **"Send e-mail"**.
     - **Expected Outcome:** The form re-renders with error messages indicating the issues.

4. **Test Pagination Links:**
   
   - On the blog list page, use the **"Next"** and **"Previous"** links to navigate between pages.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Correct posts are displayed on each page without errors.

### **5. Handling Browser Validation**

Modern browsers perform client-side validation based on form field attributes, preventing submission of invalid data. To test Django's server-side validation, you can temporarily disable browser validation by adding the `novalidate` attribute to the form:

```django
<form method="post" novalidate>
    <!-- Form fields -->
</form>
```

- **Purpose:** Allows you to submit forms with invalid data and observe Django's validation handling.
- **Reminder:** Remove the `novalidate` attribute after testing to re-enable browser validations.
