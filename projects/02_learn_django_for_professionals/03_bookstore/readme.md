# üìö Bookstore Project

Welcome to the **Bookstore Project**! In this section, we'll embark on building an online bookstore. This project includes setting up a Django project, transitioning to Docker, implementing a custom user model, and writing initial tests.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Project Setup

### 1. **Creating the Project Directory and Virtual Environment**

Start by creating a new directory for the project on your desktop, and then set up a new Python virtual environment using `pipenv`.

```bash
# Windows
cd onedrive\desktop
mkdir bookstore
cd bookstore
pipenv install
pipenv shell
pipenv install django==5.0.7
pipenv install psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
```

### 2. **Starting the Django Project**

Next, we create a new Django project called `django_project`. Make sure to include the period (`.`) at the end of the command to avoid creating unnecessary directories.

```bash
django-admin startproject django_project .
python manage.py runserver
```

In your web browser, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, where you should see the Django welcome page! üéâ

> **Note:** You may see a warning about "18 unapplied migration(s)" on the command line. It's safe to ignore this for now since we'll be switching over to Docker and PostgreSQL shortly.

### 3. **Creating the `requirements.txt` File**

Stop the local server using `Control+c` and create a `requirements.txt` file containing the current dependencies of your Python environment.

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Your `requirements.txt` file should include the following packages:

```plaintext
asgiref==3.8.1
Django==5.1
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
sqlparse==0.5.1
tzdata==2024.1
```

---

## üê≥ Docker Setup

We'll now switch over to Docker for our project. Make sure Docker is installed and running on your desktop. You'll need to create a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project‚Äôs root directory, next to `manage.py`.

### 1. **Creating Docker Configuration Files**

Create the following files in your text editor:

#### **Dockerfile**

```dockerfile
# Pull base image
FROM python:3.12-slim-bullseye

# Set environment variables
ENV PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Set work directory
WORKDIR /code

# Install dependencies
COPY ./requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy project
COPY . .
```

### üê≥ **Understanding the Dockerfile Step by Step**

#### 1. **Pulling the Base Image üì¶**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim-bullseye
```
- **FROM**: This line tells Docker to use a specific base image. Think of it as the starting point for your application.
- **python:3.10.4-slim-bullseye**: This is the base image that comes with Python 3.10.4 on a slimmed-down version of Debian Bullseye. It's lightweight, which means it has only what's necessary to run Python efficiently.

#### 2. **Setting Environment Variables üåç**
```dockerfile
ENV PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
```
- **ENV**: This command sets environment variables, which are like settings for your Python environment.
  - **PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1**: Disables the version check when using pip, speeding up the installation process.
  - **PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1**: Stops Python from writing `.pyc` files, which are compiled Python files. This keeps your environment clean.
  - **PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1**: Ensures that the output from Python is printed directly to the terminal, without being buffered. This makes it easier to see logs in real-time.

#### 3. **Setting the Work Directory üõ†Ô∏è**
```dockerfile
WORKDIR /code
```
- **WORKDIR**: This sets the working directory inside the Docker container. 
- **/code**: It's like telling Docker, "Hey, this is where we're going to put our project files." All subsequent commands will be run in this directory.

#### 4. **Installing Dependencies üìú**
```dockerfile
COPY ./requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- **COPY ./requirements.txt .**: This copies the `requirements.txt` file from your computer (or wherever you are building the Docker image) into the Docker container's working directory.
- **RUN pip install -r requirements.txt**: This command installs all the Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. It‚Äôs like setting up all the tools your project needs to run.

#### 5. **Copying the Project Files üìÅ**
```dockerfile
COPY . .
```
- **COPY . .**: This command copies all the files from your current directory on your computer into the Docker container's `/code` directory. It's like moving all your project files into the container so that it can run your application.

#### **docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: python /code/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
    environment:
      - "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust"

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

### üê≥ **Breaking Down the Docker Compose File Step by Step**

#### 1. **Setting the Version üìÖ**
```yaml
version: "3.9"
```
- **version:** This specifies the version of Docker Compose being used. Version 3.9 is a modern, stable version that supports a wide range of features.

#### 2. **Defining the Services üõ†Ô∏è**
- **services:** This section is where you define the different parts (services) of your application. Each service runs in its own container.

##### **Service 1: `web` üåê**

```yaml
web:
  build: .
  command: python /code/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
  volumes:
    - .:/code
  ports:
    - 8000:8000
  depends_on:
    - db
```

- **web:** This is the name of the service. It's like a tag for this part of your application.
- **build: .**: Tells Docker to build the `web` service using the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`). It‚Äôs like setting up the environment for this service.
- **command:** Specifies the command to run when the container starts. Here, it‚Äôs running the Django development server: `python /code/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`.
- **volumes:** 
  - `- .:/code`: This mounts your current directory (`.`) on your host machine to the `/code` directory inside the container. This means any changes you make on your host will be reflected inside the container instantly.
- **ports:** 
  - `- 8000:8000`: This maps port `8000` on your host machine to port `8000` inside the container. It allows you to access the web service from your browser by going to `http://localhost:8000`.
- **depends_on:**
  - `- db`: Indicates that the `web` service depends on the `db` service. Docker Compose ensures the `db` service is started before the `web` service.

##### **Service 2: `db` üóÑÔ∏è**

```yaml
db:
  image: postgres:16
  volumes:
    - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
  environment:
    - "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust"
```

- **db:** This is the name of the database service.
- **image: postgres:16**: Specifies the Docker image to use for the service. Here, it's pulling the PostgreSQL version 16 image from Docker Hub.
- **volumes:** 
  - `- postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/`: This mounts a named volume `postgres_data` to store the database data in the `/var/lib/postgresql/data/` directory inside the container. It ensures your data persists even if the container stops or is removed.
- **environment:** 
  - **POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust**: Sets an environment variable that configures PostgreSQL to trust all connections. This is useful for development but should be handled carefully in production environments.

#### 3. **Defining Volumes üóÇÔ∏è**

```yaml
volumes:
  postgres_data:
```
- **volumes:** This section is where named volumes are defined. 
  - **postgres_data:** A named volume to persist the database data. This ensures that your database data is not lost when containers are rebuilt or restarted.
---

### 2. **Creating `.dockerignore` and `.gitignore` Files**

Before building the Docker image, create a `.dockerignore` file and a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:

#### **.dockerignore**

```plaintext
Pipfile/
Pipfile.lock/
db.sqlite3
.git
```

#### **.gitignore**

```plaintext
Pipfile/
Pipfile.lock/
db.sqlite3
```

### 3. **Building and Running Docker Containers**

Now, let's build the Docker image and run the containers using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to see the Django welcome page, now running inside Docker! üê≥

## üóÑÔ∏è Configuring PostgreSQL

Even though we've installed `psycopg2-binary` and included PostgreSQL in our `docker-compose.yml` file, we still need to update Django's settings to use PostgreSQL.

### 1. **Updating the Database Configuration**

In `django_project/settings.py`, replace the default SQLite configuration with the following PostgreSQL settings:

```python
# django_project/settings.py

DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        "NAME": "postgres",
        "USER": "postgres",
        "PASSWORD": "postgres",
        "HOST": "db",
        "PORT": 5432,
    }
}
```

### 2. **Verifying the Setup**

After updating the settings, refresh your browser to confirm that the project is still working correctly.

## üë§ Implementing a Custom User Model

Django recommends starting with a custom user model from the beginning to avoid complications later on. We‚Äôll create a custom user model using `AbstractUser`, which is simpler and keeps the default user fields and permissions.

### 1. **Creating the Custom User Model**

Create a new app named `accounts` for the custom user model:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py startapp accounts
```

In `accounts/models.py`, define the `CustomUser` model:

```python
# accounts/models.py

from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    pass
```

### 2. **Updating `settings.py`**

Add the `accounts` app to `INSTALLED_APPS` and set the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` to our custom user model:

```python
# django_project/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    # Local
    "accounts.apps.AccountsConfig", # new
]

AUTH_USER_MODEL = "accounts.CustomUser" # new
```

### 3. **Creating and Applying Migrations**

Create the migration file for the changes and then apply the migrations:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations accounts
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

You should see the migration files created and applied successfully.

---

## üìù Custom User Forms

Next, we'll update the default user forms (`UserCreationForm` and `UserChangeForm`) to use the custom user model.

### 1. **Creating Custom Forms**

In `accounts/forms.py`, define the custom forms:

```python
# accounts/forms.py

from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm, UserChangeForm

class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):
    class Meta:
        model = get_user_model()
        fields = ("email", "username")

class CustomUserChangeForm(UserChangeForm):
    class Meta:
        model = get_user_model()
        fields = ("email", "username")
```

> **Note:** We import the custom user model using `get_user_model()` to ensure the correct model is referenced according to the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting.

### 2. **Updating the Admin Interface**

Update the `accounts/admin.py` file to manage the custom user model in the admin interface:

```python
# accounts/admin.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin

from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm, CustomUserChangeForm

CustomUser = get_user_model()

class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin):
    add_form = CustomUserCreationForm
    form = CustomUserChangeForm
    model = CustomUser
    list_display = ["email", "username", "is_superuser"]

admin.site.register(CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin)
```

---

## üîê Creating a Superuser

To verify that the custom user model is working correctly, create a superuser account:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You can use any username, email, and password you prefer. After creating the superuser, log in to the Django admin at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` using your new superuser credentials. You should see your superuser‚Äôs details displayed.

---

## üß™ Writing Tests

With our new functionality added, it's important to write tests to ensure everything works as expected. We'll start with some unit tests for the custom user model.

### 1. **Writing Unit Tests**

In `accounts/tests.py`, add the following tests:

```python
# accounts/tests.py

from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.test import TestCase

class CustomUserTests(TestCase):
    def test_create_user(self):
        User = get_user_model()
        user = User.objects.create_user(
            username="will", email="will@email.com", password="testpass123"
        )
        self.assertEqual(user

.username, "will")
        self.assertEqual(user.email, "will@email.com")
        self.assertTrue(user.is_active)
        self.assertFalse(user.is_staff)
        self.assertFalse(user.is_superuser)

    def test_create_superuser(self):
        User = get_user_model()
        admin_user = User.objects.create_superuser(
            username="superadmin", email="superadmin@email.com", password="testpass123"
        )
        self.assertEqual(admin_user.username, "superadmin")
        self.assertEqual(admin_user.email, "superadmin@email.com")
        self.assertTrue(admin_user.is_active)
        self.assertTrue(admin_user.is_staff)
        self.assertTrue(admin_user.is_superuser)
```

### 2. **Running the Tests**

To run the tests within Docker, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py test
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see all tests passing! ‚úÖ

## üóÇÔ∏è Version Control with Git

We‚Äôve accomplished quite a lot in this section, so it's a good point to commit our work to Git. Initialize a new Git repository, add the changes, and include a commit message:

```bash
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m 'Bookstore Project'
```

You can compare your work with the official source code for this section on [GitHub](https://github.com).

---

## üéâ Conclusion

Our Bookstore project is now running with Docker and PostgreSQL. We've also configured a custom user model and written initial tests. In the next section, we'll create a `pages` app for our static pages.
