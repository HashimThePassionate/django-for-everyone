# Django for Professionals

üéâ **Welcome to Django for Professionals** üéâ

This section is your guide to building professional websites using Django, a powerful Python-based web framework. There's a significant difference between creating simple "toy apps" and building a "production-ready" web application that can handle thousands or even millions of users. This section will teach you how to bridge that gap on both Windows and macOS computers.

## üå± **Getting Started**

When you first install Django and create a new project, the default settings are designed for local development. This approach makes sense: there's no need to add all the features required for a large website until you need them. Some of these default settings include:

- **SQLite** as the default database
- A local web server
- Local static asset hosting
- Built-in User model
- **DEBUG** mode turned on

For a production project, many of these settings must be reconfigured. However, even among experts, there can be a lack of agreement on the best approach. Rather than overwhelming you with all the available options, this section will show you one method for building a professional website based on current Django community best practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è **What You'll Learn**

This section covers various topics essential for professional web development, including:

- Using **Docker** for local development and deployment
- Setting up **PostgreSQL** as your database
- Creating a custom **User model**
- Implementing robust user authentication flow with email
- Comprehensive testing
- Managing environment variables
- Enhancing security and performance

By the end of this section, you will have built a professional website step-by-step and learned about additional areas for further exploration. Whether you're starting a new project aiming to be as large as Instagram (currently the largest Django website in the world) or updating an existing Django project, you'll have the tools and knowledge to succeed.

## üöÄ **Prerequisites**

Before diving into this section, it's essential to have some experience with Django and web development. If you're brand new to either, this might not be the right starting point for you. The pace here is fast, and while you could follow along, copy the code, and end up with a working website, it's recommended to start with the [`Django for Beginners` ](https://github.com/HashimThePassionate/ultimate-django-for-everyone/tree/main/projects/01_learn_django_for_beginners) section. 

In that section, you'll learn the basics by building five increasingly complex Django applications. After completing it, you'll be ready to tackle the more advanced topics covered here.

## üß∞ **Tools You Will Need**

We will primarily use **Docker** throughout this section, but there will be brief moments where having Python and Django installed locally is necessary. Additionally, Git and the command line are crucial tools for modern developers and will be used extensively in this section.
