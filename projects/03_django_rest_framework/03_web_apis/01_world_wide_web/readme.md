# 🌍 World Wide Web

## What is the Internet? 🤔

The **Internet** is a massive network of interconnected computer systems that has been around since the 1960s 📅. However, in the early days, it was very different from what we know today! It was mostly used by a **small number of networks** for government, military, or scientific purposes. These networks used the internet to **exchange information electronically** 🖥️📡.

### How It Evolved in the 1980s 🕰️

By the 1980s, research institutes and universities started using the internet to **share data**. One of the biggest internet hubs in Europe at the time was located at **CERN** (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva, Switzerland 🇨🇭, which operates the **world's largest particle physics lab** 🧪⚛️.

These labs generated **huge amounts of data** that needed to be shared with scientists from all over the world 🌎. But compared to today, internet usage back then was **tiny**. Only a **few computers** were connected, and they mainly communicated within small networks.

### The Internet Before the World Wide Web 🕸️

In the 1980s, people weren’t using the internet the way we do today. There were only a few internet nodes (points that connect computers), and most people didn’t even know what the internet was or why it was important. 👀

But that all changed when **Tim Berners-Lee**, a research scientist at CERN, had a **revolutionary idea** in 1989! 🎉

## The Birth of the World Wide Web 🌐

Tim Berners-Lee’s big insight was that **hypertext** (text that contains links to other documents) could be moved from local computer systems to the **internet** 🌍.

To do this, he invented **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**, which became the **first standard way** to share documents over the internet 📝. This invention led to the creation of **web pages**—documents that can contain links (hyperlinks) to other pages, images, audio, and video 🎥📷🎶.

### Why Is This So Important? 🚀

Thanks to Tim Berners-Lee’s invention of **HTTP**, the internet as we know it today was born. Web pages became the foundation of the **World Wide Web (WWW)**, which is the primary way people and computers communicate online.

Today, when we think of the "internet," we’re usually referring to the **World Wide Web**—the part of the internet where **billions of people** and computers interact through web pages, links, and multimedia content 🌐💻.
