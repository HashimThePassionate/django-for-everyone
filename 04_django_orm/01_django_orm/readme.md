# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Introduction

In relational databases, data is stored as rows in tables. When pulling up data from a relational database, we need to map these rows into objects. In the past, we used to do this by hand, which was repetitive and time-consuming. For each record, we had to create a new object and set its attributes. This is where an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool comes in.

## What is ORM?

An ORM is a tool that converts Python code into SQL code. The primary advantage of using an ORM is that it helps us reduce complexity in our code, makes it more understandable, and allows us to get more done in less time.

## Do We Ever Need to Write SQL?

While ORMs are incredibly useful, there are times when dealing with complex problems where ORMs can produce inefficient SQL queries. In such cases, we need to jump in and write optimized SQL queries by hand. However, overall, ORMs significantly simplify our code and development process.

## Migrations in Django

A good example of ORM usage is the migration generator in Django, which helps create tables and relationships between them. In Django, models inherit from the base `Model` class provided by the framework. This class is a part of Django’s ORM.

## Common Misconceptions

Occasionally, you might encounter someone who prefers to write every bit of code by hand, believing that ORMs are slow. What they often miss is that the more code you write, the more bugs there are to fix in the future. There is an old saying: “The best code is no code.” Writing and maintaining all that extra code costs time and money.

## Efficiency and Optimization

A good software engineer delivers working software on time. Building the best, most optimal solution that never makes it to production is not something to be proud of. The right tool for the job performs well even when dealing with complex queries, but that doesn't mean we should never use ORMs. They are suitable for most cases.

## Conclusion

Remember the old saying: "Premature optimization is the root of all evils." Do not optimize your code unless you have proven that it is slow.
